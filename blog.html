    <h3>1.The Beautiful Bali In Indonesia</h3>

    <p class="indented">
      January 2020 had to be the best month of our live's when we decided to
      travel to Bali. This trip was planned for about 6 months and that's the
      best thing we did to make our trip perfect. It was months of preparing,
      saving, going back and forth with airlines and hotels and getting our
      summer bodies in order for our first international trip. The trip
      consisted of us going to a temple at 5am, walking to the stunning beach a
      thousand times, meeting the kindest people ever from around the world,
      going to different waterfalls and scenic resorts and catching the most
      beautiful sunsets.

    <h3>2. Thrilling Thailand</h3>

    <br />
    <p class="indented">
      Here you'll find shocking cliffs jutting out of the ocean, giant flowers
      floating on crystal clear waters, and temples nestled in jungles on top of
      mountains, glittering with gold. The country's street food is just as
      incredible. We really loved being in Thailand. The buzzy nightlife in
      Bangkok had us so full of joy, we felt so safe and at peace.

    <p class="indented">
      With it's breathtaking mountain views slightly covered in snow, might be
      the best country we've been to. Being on the train and seeing the
      beautiful mountains up close felt like something out of a fairy-tale
      movie, we could not believe it. Eternally grateful for having travelled to
      Switzerland, we went at a time when it was still snowing. Booked the most
      gorgeous cabin and we learned how to ski just outside the cabin,
      experience of a lifetime. We haven't worn our skii gear since then and I
      must say we have a reason to go back skiing in Switzerland or maybe in
      Vancouver during ski season.

    <h3>4.Tulum Memories in México</h3>

    <p class="indented">
      Our trip to Tulum México was so special that we had to learn spanish
      months before we went. We figured this would help us communicate with the
      locals and this was very helpful as most only spoke Spanish. Tulum felt
      like home, that leaving after TWO whole weeks was so sad for us. The
      Mexican cuisine, the culture, amazing historical sites, turquiose beaches
      and the scenerey was all so great I encourage you to go explore the
      beautiful country of Mexico. Going back for Cancún next year.

    <h3>5.Christ the Redeemer in Brazil</h3>

    <br />
    <p class="indented">
      We went to Brazil for 5 nights and the main reason we went was to go see
      the Christ de Redeemer Statue in Rio, Brazil. The views below when we got
      to the statue were out of this world, so stunning that it feels like I saw
      them just yesterday. We didn't think we'd get to do anything but see the
      statue when we got to Rio but we were in for a surprise for those five
      days. We noticed how much football was loved in Rio, every other corner
      you would see people playing. Highlight of the trip had to be joining in
      on a friendly football match and that's the most fun I've had in so long.
      As grown as I am, it felt like Project Mbappe was in full effect.
